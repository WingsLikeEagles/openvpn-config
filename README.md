# openvpn-config
This repo contains scripts to configure OpenVPN in a semi-automated way.  Credit for the Ubuntu version goes to  
https://bryanapperson.com/blog/setup-openvpn-on-ubuntu-the-easy-way/  

The Alpine version was made by me... @WingsLikeEagles  
So, warning it may break everything.  Read the script before you run it.  It's not that long.  
I did try to use this site as a guide:
